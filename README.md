# Generative Models are Classifiers Too

The goal of this project is to show that you can use a generative model as a classifier.

We'll fine tune an LLM once per category and evaluate the joint likelihood of a given text from each of these models. This will allow us to have a full posterior for classes and should minimize overfitting.
